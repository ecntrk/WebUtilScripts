#[FlickrFriend] (http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~debmalya/free_softwares/flickrMail/)


Ever been bugged by a number of flickr contact mails that you're too lethargic to add manually by clicking each one of the mails?
Today I noticed I had 192 new contact mails. so 192 new people are following me in my flickr and it's very rude not to follow them back.

However, me being a lazy boy, I wrote a greasemonkey script that automatically browse the mail page and adds the contacts in it.

##Requirements:

You need:
- Firefox >5
- GreaseMonkey : A simple plugin to execute Javascript in Firefox.
- My Script

##How It Works
- Please Install my script.
- Open your contact information page in flickr
- The script will open 20 new tabs for each on of your mails in page. Click Ok and Do not panic. All the tabs will be closed after all the people are added in your flickr friendsList. This might take a little time depending on your processor speed, your present Copmuter workload and your internet speed.

##Here's a catch

The script only works for one page of contact mails. that is 20 mails. I have perposefully not included the capability to browse over all the mails at once. you will have to go to the next page and the process will automatically restart. 

Example: You open your most recent 20 mails. After you click Ok, 20 tas will open and then after adding people, all 20 tabs will be closed. After this, you will have to go to the 2nd page of your contact list to repeat the process for the next 20 contact emails.
Listen Carefully

After you are done with adding your contacts, Make sure you disable this script. Otherwise every time you open a people page in flickr, it'll close automatically. :-s
